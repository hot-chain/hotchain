    *  @defgroup operations Operations
    *  @ingroup transactions Transactions
    *  @brief A set of valid comands for mutating the globally shared state.
    *
    *  An operation can be thought of like a function that will modify the global
    *  shared state of the blockchain.  The members of each struct are like function
    *  arguments and each operation can potentially generate a return value.
    *
    *  Operations can be grouped into transactions (@ref transaction) to ensure that they occur
    *  in a particular order and that all operations apply successfully or
    *  no operations apply.
    *
    *  Each operation is a fully defined state transition and can exist in a transaction on its own.
    *
    *  @section operation_design_principles Design Principles
    *
    *  Operations have been carefully designed to include all of the information necessary to
    *  interpret them outside the context of the blockchain.   This means that information about
    *  current chain state is included in the operation even though it could be inferred from
    *  a subset of the data.   This makes the expected outcome of each operation well defined and
    *  easily understood without access to chain state.
    *
    *  @subsection balance_calculation Balance Calculation Principle
    *
    *    We have stipulated that the current account balance may be entirely calculated from
    *    just the subset of operations that are relevant to that account.  There should be
    *    no need to process the entire blockchain inorder to know your account's balance.
    *
    *  @subsection fee_calculation Explicit Fee Principle
    *
    *    Blockchain fees can change from time to time and it is important that a signed
    *    transaction explicitly agree to the fees it will be paying.  This aids with account
    *    balance updates and ensures that the sender agreed to the fee prior to making the
    *    transaction.
    *
    *  @subsection defined_authority Explicit Authority
    *
    *    Each operation shall contain enough information to know which accounts must authorize
    *    the operation.  This principle enables authority verification to occur in a centralized,
    *    optimized, and parallel manner.
    *
    *  @subsection relevancy_principle Explicit Relevant Accounts
    *
    *    Each operation contains enough information to enumerate all accounts for which the
    *    operation should apear in its account history.  This principle enables us to easily
    *    define and enforce the @balance_calculation. This is superset of the @ref defined_authority
