   /**
    * @defgroup transactions Transactions
    *
    * All transactions are sets of messages that must be applied atomically (all succeed or all fail). 
    * Transactions must refer to a recent block that defines the context of the operation so that they 
    * assert a known state-precondition assumed by the transaction signers.
    *
    * Rather than specify a full block number, we only specify the lower 16 bits of the block number 
    * which means you can reference any block within the last 65,536 blocks which is 2.2 days with 
    * a 3 second block interval.
    *
    * All transactions must expire so that the network does not have to maintain a 
    * permanent record of all transactions ever published.  A transaction may not have an 
    * expiration date too far in the future because this would require keeping too much 
    * transaction history in memory.
    *
    * The block prefix is the first 4 bytes of the block hash of the reference block number, which is the second 4
    * bytes of the @ref block_id_type (the first 4 bytes of the block ID are the block number)
    *
    * Note: A transaction which selects a reference block cannot be migrated between forks outside the period of
    * ref_block_num.time to (ref_block_num.time + rel_exp * interval). This fact can be used to protect market orders
    * which should specify a relatively short re-org window of perhaps less than 1 minute. Normal payments should
    * probably have a longer re-org window to ensure their transaction can still go through in the event of a momentary
    * disruption in service.
    *
    * @note It is not recommended to set the @ref ref_block_num, @ref ref_block_prefix, and @ref expiration
    * fields manually. Call the appropriate overload of @ref set_expiration instead.
